Noe is a framework for an easier scientific computation in object pascal, especially to build neural networks, and hence the name — *noe (Korean:뇌) means brain*. It supports the creation of arbitrary rank tensor and its arithmetical operations. Some of the key features:
- Automatic gradient computation
- Numpy-style broadcasting
- Interface with *OpenBLAS* for some heavy-lifting
- Interface with *GNU plot* for plotting

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/ariaghora/noe/wiki) for more documentation. Please note that this framework is developed and heavily tested using fpc 3.0.4, with object pascal syntax mode, on a windows machine. Portability is not really my first concern right now, but any helps are sincerely welcome.

> **A blatant disclaimer -** *This is my learning and experimental project. The development is still early and active. That said, the use for production is not encouraged at this moment.*
