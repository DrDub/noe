Noe is a framework for neural networks for object pascal. Some of its features:
- Creation of arbitrary rank tensors
- Automatic gradient computation
- Support of some arithmetical operations
- Numpy-style broadcasting
- Interface with *OpenBLAS* for some heavy-lifting
- Interface with *GNU plot* for plotting

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/ariaghora/noe/wiki) for more documentation.

> *This is my experimental project to understand the mechanism behind n-dimensional array: how is its layout in memory, how to do indexing, etc. Furthermore, I am also learning what happens under the hood of the automatic differentiation for a neural network in near future. That said, noe is developed towards the implementation of neural networks (therefore the name). So, this project might be a good basis for it.*
