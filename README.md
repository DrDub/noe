Noe is a framework for an easier scientific computation in object pascal, especially to build neural networks (and thus, the name — *noe (Korean:뇌) means brain*). It supports the creation of arbitrary rank tensor and its arithmetical operations. Some of the key features:
- Automatic gradient computation
- Numpy-style broadcasting
- Interface with *OpenBLAS* for some heavy-lifting
- Interface with *GNU plot* for plotting

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/ariaghora/noe/wiki) for more documentation.

> **A blatant disclaimer -** *This is my experimental project to understand the mechanism behind n-dimensional array: how is its layout in memory, how to do indexing, etc. Furthermore, I am also learning what happens under the hood of the automatic differentiation for a neural network in near future. That said, the use for production is not encouraged at this moment.*
