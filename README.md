This is my experimental project to understand the mechanism behind n-dimensional array: how is its layout in memory, how to do indexing, etc. Furthermore, I am also learning what happens under the hood of the automatic differentiation for a neural network in near future. That said, noe (In Korean: 뇌, means “brain”) is developed towards the implementation of neural networks (therefore the name). So, this project might be a good basis for it.

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/ariaghora/noe/wiki) for more documentation.

Some of its features:
- Creation of arbitrary rank tensors
- Support of some arithmetical operations
- Numpy-style broadcasting
- Interface with BLAS routine 

> This project used to be "darkteal". Please check the `master` branch for darkteal's code. There are some machine learning stuffs there. It is not abandoned. It is being upgraded with a better data representation... ;)
