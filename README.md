Noe is a framework for neural networks for object pascal. Some of its features:
- Creation of arbitrary rank tensors
- Automatic gradient computation
- Support of some matrix and tensor operations
- Numpy-style broadcasting
- Interface with *OpenBLAS* for some heavy-lifting
- Interface with *GNU plot* for plotting

> **A blatant disclaimer -** *This is my experimental project to understand the mechanism behind n-dimensional array: how is its layout in memory, how to do indexing, etc. Furthermore, I am also learning what happens under the hood of the automatic differentiation for a neural network in near future. That said, the use for production is not encouraged at this moment.*
