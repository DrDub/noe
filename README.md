Noe is a framework for an easier scientific computation in object pascal, especially to build neural networks (and thus, the name — *noe (Korean:뇌) means brain*). It supports the creation of arbitrary rank tensor and its arithmetical operations. Some of the key features:
- Automatic gradient computation
- Numpy-style broadcasting
- Interface with *OpenBLAS* for some heavy-lifting
- Interface with *GNU plot* for plotting

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/ariaghora/noe/wiki) for more documentation.
